# Creating Album Review website

This is my first attempt at creating a React application. I have never used React before, so this will be a learning experience.

I use the [GoogleSheets API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-spreadsheet) to get the data from our shared google sheets document and display it on screen.

Purpose:
Create a website for people to visit and see our terrible reviews on different albums. 

Planned Features:
- Allow filtering so users can find albums or artists they care about
- Possibly having a rating system so if people agree or disagree they can let us know
- A way for users to recommend new albums for us to listen to and review
- Cover art for all albums from the Spotify API
- Spotify integration so users can listen to albums while on the site (Spotify premium users only)
